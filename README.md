# TCPlp Experiments on Commodity Hardware

Implementation of TCPlp experiments for Adafruit Express nrf52840. Unlike the research project, we leverage a commodity development board and the now merged TCPlp implementation within [OpenThread](https://github.com/openthread/openthread/pull/6650#issuecomment-1027330004). Additionally, we use the Nordic Semiconductor NRF Connect SDK as required by our board.
